<p>A: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.</p>

<p>A: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. </p>

<p>Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html">more information for health care providers</a> about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.</p>

<p>A: No. Always follow the instructions on household cleaners. Do not use disinfect sprays or wipes on your skin because it may cause skin and eye irritation. Disinfectant sprays or wipes are not intended for use on humans or animals. Disinfectant sprays or wipes are intended for use on hard, non-porous surfaces.</p>

<p>A. The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">advises the CDC</a>. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. </p>

<p>A. Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores have run out of hand sanitizers and they may be difficult to find. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the public health emergency posed by COVID-19. </p>

<p>The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.</p>

<p>A: Blood donors must be healthy and feel well on the day of donation.

<p>A: Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins  that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of illness, reduce morbidity, or prevent death associated with COVID-19.</p>

We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control).</p>

<p>Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeutics">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020</a>. Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. In a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bd524888-1b4f-4334-9410-e6b72f3dcbba" href="/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or" title="FDA cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems">Drug Safety Communication</a>, the FDA cautions against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to the risk of heart rhythm problems.</p>

<p>A. No. Products marketed for veterinary use, “for research only,” or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness and <strong>should never be used by humans</strong>. FDA is aware that chloroquine phosphate is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled. The agency continues to work with online marketplaces to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts. Patients should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider. Chloroquine products also should not be given to pets or livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian. </p>

<p>A: Yes, there are tests for COVID-19. Though there is currently no FDA-approved or cleared test for COVID-19, the FDA has issued several Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs). During public health emergencies declared under section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act, the FDA is able to issue EUAs when certain criteria are met that allows for the use and distribution of potentially life-saving medical products to diagnose, treat, or prevent the disease, which can include diagnostic tests.

<p>A. To be tested for COVID-19, a sample is typically collected from your nose and/or throat with a special swab at a designated collection location staffed by health care professionals. Currently, a health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred choice. Alternatively, the health care professional may swab the back of your throat, or for patients with symptoms of COVID-19, the inside of the front of the nose. Depending on, among other things, the type of swab used, a health care professional may collect the sample, or you may be able to collect the sample yourself at the collection site under the supervision of health care personnel. Testing of the sample is performed in a laboratory on the prescription or order of a health care professional.  </p>

<p>A: At this time, the FDA has not authorized any COVID-19 test to be completely used and processed at home. However, on April 20, 2020, the FDA authorized the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6838a1f6-9dd4-498f-8d53-456dec3812ae" href="/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection" title="Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First Test for Patient At-Home Sample Collection">first COVID-19 test for home collection of samples</a> to be sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. Please note that this authorization is specific only to the test that has been issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which has a home collection option (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136148/download">LabCorp’s COVID-19 RT-PCR Test</a>). Any COVID-19 test intended for at-home testing, including self-collection of a sample at home, with or without the use of telemedicine, must be authorized by the FDA. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers in this space. You can find listings of tests that have have been issued an EUA on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d8d1b0-6593-4914-941d-26b0225c5d0c" href="/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization" title="Emergency Use Authorization">Emergency Use Authorizations</a> page.</p>

<p>The FDA is supportive of at-home testing for COVID-19 if there is data and science to support consumer safety and test accuracy. We are actively working with developers on EUAs for at-home tests that demonstrate appropriate validation. Home collection raises several issues of importance, including whether the lay user can safely and properly collect the sample, whether the components of the test kit are safe for use in the home environment (since some components may be toxic), proper shipment, and stability of the sample (such as, if the sample sits in a hot truck). A physician watching the collection via telemedicine may address the issue of sample collection (if the self-collection method does not raise safety concerns), but telemedicine does not address these other issues.</p>

<p>A: There are currently two types of tests available for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests detect the virus and can be used to directly diagnose COVID-19 and antibody tests detect the body’s immune response to the infection caused by the virus but cannot be used to definitively diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Currently, molecular tests are the only type of tests that can be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. Antibody tests cannot be used alone to rule out COVID-19.</p>

<ol><li>Molecular Tests: “Nucleic acid amplification tests,” or “NAAT” tests are molecular tests that detect the virus’s genetic material. FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for dozens of molecular tests. Based on current data, we believe these EUA-authorized tests are highly accurate tests.</li>
	<li>Antibody Tests: Antibody (or serology) tests detect antibodies in the blood when the body is fighting an infection. The test does not detect the actual virus; rather, it detects the body’s immune response to the virus. In the early days of an infection, antibodies may not be detected, limiting the effectiveness of an antibody test. This type of test may also be falsely positive if antibodies to a coronavirus other than the pandemic novel strain are present. Because of this potential for false negative and false positive results, an antibody test should not be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. FDA has also issued EUAs for serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More information on serology tests can be found in the Serology section of FAQs on Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2.</li>

<p>A: Antibody tests cannot be used alone to rule out COVID-19. However, they can serve an important role. Using antibody tests on many patients may help the medical community better understand the immune response in patients over time and how many people may have been infected. In the future, it is also possible that they may also be used to help determine, together with other clinical data, that some individuals are no longer susceptible to infection. In addition, these test results can aid in determining who may donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma, which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19.</p>

<p>A. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes protective clothing, gowns, gloves, face shields, goggles, face masks, and respirators or other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness. While it is possible to use 3D printing to make certain PPE, there are technical challenges. 3D-printed PPE may provide a physical barrier, but 3D-printed PPE are unlikely to provide the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection as FDA-cleared surgical masks and N95 respirators.

<p>A: Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. </p>

<p>If you are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare food for eating and before you eat. Consumers can follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">CDC guidelines on frequent hand washing</a> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.</p>

<p>It is critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—<a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety">clean, separate, cook, and chill</a>.</p>

<p>A: Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.   </p>

<p>Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness and not gastrointestinal illness, and foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.</p>

<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

<p>A: Certain veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in pets if needed. </p>

<p>Diagnostic tests for animals are regulated differently than those for humans. The FDA does not require approval or clearance of a 510(k), PMA, or any other pre-market submission for devices, including diagnostic tests, intended for animal use. The FDA does, however, have post-market regulatory oversight over devices intended for animal use and can take appropriate regulatory action if an animal device is misbranded or adulterated.</p>

<p>Certain private, state, and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in dogs and cats. The FDA is also aware of at least two veterinary tests for COVID-19 in pets developed by commercial laboratories initially for internal surveillance, but the agency has not evaluated the validity of these tests. The tests are not currently available for routine testing. The decision to test pets should be made collaboratively between local, state, or federal public and animal health officials.</p>

<p>A: We currently don’t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species. We are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. </p>

<p>On April 22, 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection in two pet cats. These are the first pets in the United States to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. The cats lived in two separate areas of New York state. Both had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with COVID-19. </p>

<p>A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus; it was the first confirmed case of COVID-19 infection in an animal in the United States. </p>

<p>Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.</p>

<p>A: We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. FDA is aware of a very small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The majority of these cases were linked to close contact with people who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, play a role in spreading COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.</p>

<p>People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.</p>

<p>A: The FDA, USDA and CDC recommend that any testing of animals should be conducted using kits not required when testing people. USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) and the laboratories of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) use tests developed for animal testing that are not used for testing in people. This avoids placing additional stresses on human testing resources while also recognizing the potential importance of animal testing to supporting public health. </p>

<p>Although animal and human tests are generally similar, this type of testing has to be adjusted in each species and for each sample type (blood, feces, nasal swab). Human and animal tests are not intended to be interchangeable. Some testing performed on animals is based on the published tests used in people, but animal testing is not likely to reduce the availability of tests for people if labs follow recommendations from FDA, USDA, and CDC that animal testing be conducted using tests developed for animals.</p>

<p>A: No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/veterinary-biologics">Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB)</a> regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin. Similarly, APHIS CVB has not licensed any products to treat or prevent COVID-19 in animals.</p>

<p>The FDA has taken action against unapproved products claiming to prevent or cure COVID-19. The public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any products claiming to do so to <a href="mailto:FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov">FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov</a> or 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332).</p>

<p>A: Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.</p>

<p>Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.</p>

<p>Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.</p>

<p>Other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. More information is available in the American Veterinary Medical Association’s <a href="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/AVMA-Coronavirus-Taxonomy-Notes.pdf">fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species</a>.</p>
