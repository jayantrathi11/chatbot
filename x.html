        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause infection in humans and various animals, including birds and mammals such as camels, cats and bats. Some animal coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are communicable from animals to humans. To date, it has been confirmed that seven coronaviruses can also cause infection in humans. When animal coronaviruses evolve, infect humans and spread between humans, this can lead to outbreaks such as MERS-CoV and SARS.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            COVID-19 is a new strain of the coronavirus which has not previously been detected in humans. The outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.
The outbreak initially appeared to be linked to South China Seafood City. Seafood, chickens, bats, marmots and other wild animals are sold at this market, suggesting that the virus likely originates from an animal source. The virus is human-to-human transmissible and has meanwhile spread to other countries.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            The symptoms range from mild to severe respiratory disorders with fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. The elderly and people with existing chronic conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious symptoms. Certain population groups are considered to be more at risk; they are more vulnerable to developing serious symptoms. These are mainly people over 65 years of age and people suffering from serious chronic diseases.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            The chance that a healthy person in their twenties, thirties or forties will get the coronavirus is just as high as the chance that someone else becomes infected by the virus. Hospital admissions and other complications related to the coronavirus are rare within this age group. However, complications are rare in this age group, which means that few people need to be hospitalised due to the coronavirus.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            There is no scientific evidence that pregnant women are more vulnerable to this infection or to its consequences. It is reassuring that there are few pregnant women among the very ill. There are also very few serious cases of infection among women of childbearing age. There is no evidence that an infection during pregnancy has a negative effect on the fetus or that the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            Children may also become infected with the coronavirus, but they run little risk of becoming very ill. However, they can easily transmit the virus, even if they have no symptoms yet. We therefore advise avoiding contact between children and risk groups, such as their grandparents.

            Stay home as much as possible. Avoid contact with others outside your family and follow all hygiene measures carefully. It is also better for family members to avoid contacts with other people.

            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses. The seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19. The pneumococcal vaccine does not protect against viral pneumonia.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            The coronavirus spreads from human to human via small droplets that are released when coughing and sneezing. Via these droplets, the virus ends up in the air, on objects and surfaces. Whoever inhales these droplets or gets them through their hands into their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. There is no evidence that the contamination occurs through the skin. The risk of infection is reduced by keeping more than a metre away from sick people, touching one’s face as little as possible and paying attention to good hand hygiene.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            Wearing face masks to prevent coronavirus infection, only makes sense in hospitals where patients with the coronavirus are treated and in laboratories where specimens of these patients are tested. It is clear that wearing a face mask – even a so-called comfort mask – will also play an important role in the phase-out strategy.
If you want to know more about the usefulness of a mouth mask, please read: <a href="https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/facemask/">https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/facemask/</a>

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            This risk exists, but is much smaller than through direct contact with an infected person.
In ideal conditions, the corona virus survives on average around three hours on smooth surfaces and materials (such as door handles, handrails, tables, etc.). On absorbent materials (such as cardboard, paper, textiles, etc.), the virus cannot survive well. The virus is very sensitive to dehydration, heat and sunlight.
Anyone who ingests virus droplets via contact with hands in their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. It is important to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after contact with surfaces and packaging that are touched by many people.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            There is currently no evidence that the coronavirus will slow down or disappear due to spring weather. If we compare with other coronaviruses, it is possible that the new virus will also show a seasonal course, and that spring will slow down the spread due to higher temperatures and UV light. After a few months out of circulation, the virus may come back later. However, it is too early to know the pattern of this virus.

            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            Taking and touching objects from people and passing them on is hard to avoid. Hence the importance to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly. Try to be especially careful to touch your face with your hands as little as possible.

            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            <p>To this day, food has not been identified as a probable source or route of transmission of the virus. In addition, coronaviruses are not highly resistant viruses in the environment and are rapidly inactivated when they end up on surfaces. In the current state of knowledge, the likelihood of a consumer becoming contaminated with Covid-19 through food is therefore very low and unproven. Whatever the case, the FASFC reminds professionals that compliance with good hygiene practices is essential and prevents most contaminations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare food separately, especially when handling raw meat,</li>
<li>Wash food preparation surfaces, especially those used for raw meat preparations, with soap and hot water,</li>
<li>Wash hands with soap and warm water between each handling of food,</li>
<li>Cook all raw meat sufficiently (70°C through for at least 2 minutes),</li>
<li>Avoid preparing food if you are sick.</li>

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            The risk of contracting Covid-19 through contact with pets is currently considered negligible, as Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through close contact between humans. Even though Covid-19 is suspected to have originated from wild animals and has since adapted to humans (making it a ‘humanised’ virus), until now there is no evidence to suggest that pets pose a risk to humans due to the transmission of Covid-19. That is why we advise you to apply the general rules of hygiene (avoid close contact with your pet, especially if you are sick, wash your hands after touching an animal) if you come into contact with animals that may carry the virus for a brief period of time due to environmental contamination.

            If you feel sick, have a cough, a sore throat, breathing difficulties, and have a fever of more than 38 degrees, the coronavirus is one of the viruses you may have contracted. Moreover, if you have recently traveled to one of the countries that have been severely affected by the coronavirus, such as China or Italy, or if you have been in contact with people who have been infected or who have traveled there, you need to be even more vigilant.

            <p>Everyone can contribute to the fight against the coronavirus! Some people may be infected with the coronavirus but not show any symptoms, which means they do not know that they can transmit the virus.Anyone can apply the following hygiene measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Very important: wash your hands regularly with soap and water.</li>
<li>Sneeze and cough into a paper tissue. Use a new paper tissue every time and dispose of it in a lidded bin.</li>
<li>If you have no tissue at hand, cough or sneeze in your elbow.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is safer to keep enough distance in your social interactions to slow down the spread of the virus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid shaking hands or kissing when greeting someone.</li>
<li>Watch out for those most at risk: people over 65 years of age, diabetics, people with heart, lung or kidney diseases, children under 6 months of age, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system.<br>
-Children do not get seriously ill from the coronavirus, but they can spread it easily. That is why contact between children and older people should be avoided.</li>
<li>Avoid contact with people who are visibly ill, or keep your distance.</li>

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and contact with infected surfaces, not by air. Wearing a face mask therefore offers no protection against infection if someone does not have close contact (within a distance of 1.5 meters) with a sick person. Wearing gloves is not recommended, as it gives a false sense of security, people still touch their nose, mouth and eyes if they are wearing gloves, whereby they can still get infected. It is much better to wash hands regularly with soap and water.

            There is no exception to the usual rules in this type of situation: the consumer must inform the seller of the defect (mail, e-mail, etc.) as soon as possible and not make the damage worse.
The consumer will therefore be able to prove that the problem occurred during this exceptional period and that they have taken the necessary steps to inform the seller as required.
From that moment on, the warranty period will in principle be suspended until the seller offers a solution (repair or replacement).
Even if they have not been able to receive the information because of a closure due to COVID-19, the seller cannot invoke the fact that the legal term has expired in order not to intervene.

            The general rules also apply to special occasions or religious high days: religious gatherings cannot take place in places of worship. Family gatherings are limited to the family members living in the same residence and must take place in that residence. The specific food shops where extra shopping may be bought in this context can remain open according to the applicable rules for food shops. They must ensure that the rules are applied, in particular where a larger number of customers are expected. The mayor will communicate these measures to the parties in question. The police and the mayor will ensure compliance.

            Companies and employers must organise their activities in compliance with the exceptional legal requirements resulting from the pandemic. A company can therefore implement a shift system to be able to comply with keeping a distance of 1.5 metres.
The COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be an &lsquo;occurred accident&rsquo; within the meaning of the Labour Code, and the crossing of labour boundaries is permitted. The hours worked in this context fall under the normal overtime regime. There is no special compensation, but the overtime regime applies.

        <div class="faq_answer panel">
            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            The COVID-19 pandemic can be regarded as an occurred accident (and to some extent an imminent accident) within the meaning of the Labour Code of 16 March 1971, which allows working time limits to be exceeded in order to perform work to cope with the situation. Night work and Sunday work is also permitted in this case. Work may be performed outside the normal timetables.
Hours worked in the context of an occurred or imminent accident do fall under the normal overtime regime and entitle the holder to overtime hours (more than 9 hours per day or 40 hours per week or lower CLA limit). In the event of hours worked on Sundays and during the night, however, the extra pay stipulated in the sectoral or company CLAs do apply.
Companies and employees must organise their activities according to the measures taken by the government to tackle COVID-19. These measures are a consequence of the pandemic and are therefore an inherent part of the concept of &ldquo;occurred accident&rdquo;. The new organisational needs which are directly linked to the enforcement of these measures or which respond to the consequences of these measures are therefore also triggered by an &ldquo;occurred accident&rdquo;. Also in such cases, employers will be able to let their employees work overtime as well as outside the normal timetables.

            <div class="faq-answer-wrapper">
            From 13 March 2020, the notion of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will be flexibly applied by the NEO. All situations of temporary unemployment resulting from COVID-19 can be considered as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even if, for example, it is still possible to work on certain days.
For the time being, this flexible arrangement will apply until 5 April 2020. This period may be extended until 30 June 2020 if the measures are extended or tightened by the government.
Consequently, no application for recognition as a company in difficulty needs to be submitted to the FPS Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue.
If the temporary unemployment is not the result of COVID-19, the employer can still invoke the system of temporary unemployment on economic grounds.

            <p>The general principle is that any person with Belgian nationality, with or without their main residence in Belgium, long-term residents in Belgium and persons with legal residence in Belgium, may return to Belgium subject to two conditions.
The two conditions are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person must remain in self-isolation at home for 14 days; and</li>
<li>The person is prohibited from working outdoors for 14 days (even if they are employed in an essential sector), although teleworking is still permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two conditions apply to returning persons and cover all possible modes of transport used (air, land and sea) for their return.</p>
<p>In the case of return via a domestic or an airport abroad, these two conditions also apply to the person who is going to pick up the returning person(s), but not to the rest of the family who live under the same roof. The person picking up the returning person should preferably be a family member, but if the family members are employed in an essential sector, it is not recommended that they pick up the returning person.</p>
<p>These two conditions do not apply to frontier workers, drivers employed by professional transport companies and persons who have made an essential journey abroad (as listed under the question &ldquo;Is it still allowed to travel abroad from Belgium?&quot;), with the exception of persons who have gone to pick up returning persons from an airport abroad (see previous paragraph).</p>
<p>As a rule, the returning person, regardless of whether they arrive on Belgian territory or another country, uses public transport (taxi or rental car) to get to their destination;
If public transport/taxi is not an option, the returning person can be picked up by another person (preferably a member of the same family, but not employed in an essential sector);
Preferably, no more than two people should travel in the vehicle. An exception to this is if several persons from the same family have to be picked up.
During the travel, social distancing measures must be respected.
Remark:
The person picking up another person must be in possession of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An identity document and/or passport; and</li>
<li>If the pick-up takes place abroad, credible evidence to cross the border justifying the essential journey.</li>
